# A little something to get you started
Firstly view source of the main page. 
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<style>
			body {
				background-image: url("background.png");
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>Welcome to level 0.  Enjoy your stay.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
It's noticeable that there exists a file named "background.png".
Open it by adding the filename to present url, and the flag will be shown.
